df_children <- read.csv('./Data/birthweight.csv') %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  mutate(babysex = factor(babysex, levels = c(1, 2), labels = c("male", "female")),
         frace = factor(frace, levels = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 9), labels = c("White", "Black", "Asian", "Puerto Rican", "Other", "Unknown")),
         malform = factor(malform, levels = c(0, 1), labels = c("absent", "present")),
         mrace = factor(mrace, levels = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 8), labels = c("White", "Black", "Asian", "Puerto Rican", "Other")))
